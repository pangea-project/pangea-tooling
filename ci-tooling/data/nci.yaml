# This is a list of job_name parts that we want to not have any QA done on.
# The implementation is a bit ugh so this should be used very very very very
# sparely and best avoided if at all possible as we can expect this property
# to go away for a better solution at some point in the future.
# The array values basically are job_name.include?(x) matched.
